                           TLS Key Injection
                     draft-jhoyla-tls-key-injection

Abstract

   TLS is sometimes used in situations where it is necessary to inject
   extra key material into the handshake.  This draft aims to describe
   some methods for doing so securely.  This key material must be
   injected in such a way that both parties agree on what is being
   injected and why, and further in what order.

Note to Readers

   Discussion of this document takes place on the TLS Working Group
   mailing list (tls@ietf.org), which is archived at
   https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/tls/ [1].

   Source for this draft and an issue tracker can be found at
   https://github.com/jhoyla/draft-jhoyla-tls-key-injection [2].
